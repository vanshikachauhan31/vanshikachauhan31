## 🧭 My Learning Compass
I believe Data Science is not about tools first,  
but about **thinking clearly with data**.

Right now, I focus on:
- Understanding **how data behaves**
- Writing **clean and readable code**
- Solving **small problems deeply**, not many problems superficially

---

## 🔍 Areas I’m Exploring
- Programming foundations (C, Python)
- Data handling & basic analysis
- Statistics essentials for decision making
- Problem-solving using logic & structure

---

## 🧪 Learning Lab (Projects)
This GitHub is my **learning laboratory**.

Projects here may look simple — but each one teaches:
- how to break a problem down
- how to think before coding
- how to improve step-by-step

**Current experiments:**
- Student Performance Analyzer (C)
- Basic Statistics Toolkit
- Core C Programs (loops, arrays, functions)
- HTML pages for structured data display
